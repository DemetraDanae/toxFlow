R code for toxFlow application. toxFlow is a Shiny application that was build under R version 3.2.3. In this repository ui.R and server.R files are uploaded, as well as additional files and a manual.

toxFlow is an application of web tools for Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) and toxicity prediction using read across technique. toxFlow is developed as a project for my Diploma Thesis, in School of Chemical Engineering (National Technical University of Athens, March-September 2016). Additional information about the employed methods and an detailed case study, can be found in the corresponding publication; Varsou DD, Tsiliki G, Nymark P, Kohonen P, Grafstr√∂m R, and Sarimveis H, <b> toxFlow: A Web-Based Application for Read-Across Toxicity Prediction Using Omics and Physicochemical Data </b>, J. Chem. Inf. Model.

This application is hosted in the server of Unit of Process Control & Informatics of School of Chemical Engineering (NTUA), in the following <a href="http://147.102.86.129:3838/toxflow/"> link </a>.
